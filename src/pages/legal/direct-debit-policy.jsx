            <p>
              By authorising a Direct Debit mandate through our secure payment processor (Stripe),
              you permit PJH Web Services to collect recurring payments from your nominated bank
              account in accordance with your agreed package and payment schedule. All mandates are
              processed under the UK BACS scheme.

            <p>
              You will receive advance notice by email at least three (3) working days before any
              Direct Debit is collected, detailing the amount and date of the payment. You should
              check this notice and contact us immediately if any details are incorrect.

            <p>
              The Direct Debit Guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept
              instructions to pay Direct Debits. If there are any changes to the amount, date or
              frequency of your Direct Debit, PJH Web Services (via Stripe Payments UK, Ltd.) will
              notify you in advance of your account being debited or as otherwise agreed. If an
              error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit, by PJH Web Services, Stripe, or
              your bank, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund from your bank or building
              society.

            <p>
              You may cancel your Direct Debit at any time by contacting your bank or building
              society. Please also notify PJH Web Services in writing to avoid interruption of
              service. Cancellation before your minimum term may result in early termination
              charges as detailed in your service agreement.

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">5. Failed or Rejected Payments</h2>
            <p>
              If a Direct Debit payment fails or is returned unpaid, PJH Web Services reserves the
              right to suspend services until payment is received. Repeated failed payments may
              incur late fees or service suspension, as outlined in our standard terms.

              FCA-authorised payment institution. PJH Web Services does not store or have access to
